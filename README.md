# Machine Learning Stephen Marsland
A Repository of implementations of all algorithms from Stephen Marsland's Machine Learning an Algorithmic Perspective



## Chapter 1 - Perceptron
Within the Perceptron Directory you will find a fully functional Perceptron object in `perceptron.py` with
an example of it working on the logical operators `AND` and `XOR`.



## Chapter 2 - Multi-Layered Perceptron
Within the Multi-Layered Perceptron directory you will find a MLP implementation. Running the base `MLP.py` file the MLP will
learn the `AND` and `XOR` operation. There are two other examples within the directory as well. The first is a regression example that outputs a plot (found in the directory that `regression.py` lives)
showing how well it learned. The second is a classification example using the iris dataset from the `UCI Machine Learning Repository`.
